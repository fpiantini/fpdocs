- [ncdu]: NCurses Disk Usage. Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface.
It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire
graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems.
Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal
POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.
